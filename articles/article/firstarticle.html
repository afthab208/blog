    <h1>Why Is Javascript So Cool ?</h1>
    
    <p>JavaScript has never had any official solution for distributing packages, and every web platform (Rails, Django etc) has their own idea of how to structure and package JavaScript. In the last few years, NPM has started becoming the canonical way of distribution, with Webpack as the build system, but thereâ€™s no way to load NPM packages in the browser without a server-side component.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
    
    <p>The Javascript world is today's the most vibrant development ecosystem. It's popularity propelled it from a simple scripting gadget to the backbone of today's web. Browsers are more powerful each passing day, NPM registry grows to whooping 1 million packages and Node has long shown it's a competent back-end language.</p>
